Not every day in a developer's journey involves writing code. Today was dedicated to career development and strategic networking - specifically, connecting with **DIIO**, a Chilean AI-powered sales technology company that caught my attention for their innovative approach to sales automation and their need for junior developers with AI expertise.

## Discovering DIIO

While researching AI companies in Chile's growing tech ecosystem, I came across DIIO through their LinkedIn presence. Their company description immediately resonated with my background in artificial intelligence and data science:

> "diio empodera a las empresas revolucionando c√≥mo gestionan y operan sus equipos de ventas, todo ello impulsado por inteligencia artificial avanzada."

DIIO's mission centers on transforming sales team management through advanced AI, acting as an artificial sales expert that ensures salespeople follow company standards while providing data-driven feedback on customer interactions.

## What DIIO Does

DIIO's platform addresses several critical pain points in modern sales operations:

### **AI-Powered Sales Coaching**
- Real-time feedback based on customer interactions
- Standards compliance monitoring for sales teams
- Coaching recommendations based on latest consultative selling research

### **Sales Process Automation**
- Automatic CRM updates
- Follow-up email drafting
- Customer conversation record keeping
- Client summary generation

### **Performance Optimization**
- Commitment checklists
- Comparison against custom sales playbooks
- Data-driven strategy refinement tools

The company positions itself as providing Latin American consultative sales companies with an unparalleled competitive advantage in an evolving sales landscape.

## The Opportunity: Junior Developer - RAG Systems

The position that caught my eye involves developing **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems** - a perfect intersection of my academic background and current AI trends. RAG systems combine the power of large language models with external knowledge retrieval, making them ideal for:

- **Customer interaction analysis**
- **Sales playbook integration**
- **Real-time coaching recommendations**
- **Automated content generation**

## Why I'm a Strong Candidate

My experience from **Advanced Topics in Artificial Intelligence (IIC3692)** at UC provides directly relevant background:

### **RAG System Understanding**
- Vector databases and embedding techniques
- Information retrieval algorithms
- Language model integration and fine-tuning
- Prompt engineering and optimization

### **Practical AI Implementation**
- Experience with modern AI frameworks (transformers, LangChain)
- Understanding of production AI system challenges
- Knowledge of ML model deployment and scaling

### **Software Development Foundation**
- Full-stack development capabilities
- Database design and optimization (crucial for RAG systems)
- API development and integration
- Performance optimization and monitoring

## The Strategic Approach

Rather than just submitting a standard application, I decided to take a more strategic approach:

### **1. Direct Recruitment Contact**
I reached out directly to DIIO's recruitment team through LinkedIn, highlighting:
- Specific interest in their RAG system development role
- Relevant coursework and practical AI experience
- Understanding of their business model and technical challenges

### **2. Demonstrating Technical Competence**
Tomorrow's plan involves building a practical RAG implementation to:
- Refresh my knowledge of current RAG architectures
- Create a tangible demonstration of my capabilities
- Prepare for technical discussions during the interview process

### **3. Industry Research**
Understanding DIIO's competitive landscape and technical challenges:
- AI-powered sales tools market in Latin America
- Current RAG system implementations in business applications
- Integration challenges with existing CRM systems

## Tomorrow's Technical Deep-Dive

The next development session will focus on implementing a RAG system from scratch, covering:

### **Core Components**
- Document ingestion and preprocessing
- Vector embedding generation and storage
- Similarity search and retrieval mechanisms
- LLM integration for response generation

### **Technical Stack**
- **Vector Database**: Pinecone, Weaviate, or FAISS
- **Embeddings**: OpenAI embeddings or open-source alternatives
- **LLM Integration**: OpenAI GPT or open-source models
- **Framework**: LangChain or custom implementation

### **Use Case Simulation**
Building a simplified version of what DIIO might need:
- Sales conversation analysis
- Playbook-based recommendation generation
- Customer interaction summarization

## The Bigger Picture

This opportunity represents more than just a job application - it's a chance to:

### **Apply Academic Knowledge**
Translate theoretical AI concepts from university coursework into real-world business solutions that directly impact sales team performance.

### **Enter Chile's AI Ecosystem**
DIIO represents the growing AI startup scene in Chile, offering exposure to cutting-edge technology development in a Latin American context.

### **Build Specialized Expertise**
RAG systems are becoming increasingly important in enterprise AI applications, making this role an excellent stepping stone for AI engineering career development.

### **Combine Technical and Business Skills**
Working at the intersection of AI technology and sales automation provides valuable experience in business-focused AI applications.

## Lessons in Career Development

Today reinforced several important principles about career growth in tech:

### **Proactive Networking**
Reaching out directly to companies, especially in emerging fields like AI, often yields better results than passive application submission.

### **Technical Preparation**
Having practical projects and implementations ready demonstrates genuine interest and competence beyond academic credentials.

### **Strategic Positioning**
Understanding a company's specific technical challenges allows for more targeted and compelling candidacy presentation.

The combination of strong academic foundation from UC's Computer Engineering program and practical development skills positions me well for this type of specialized AI role. Tomorrow's RAG system implementation will serve as both technical preparation and demonstration of continued learning commitment.
