With the D3.js foundation in place, it was time to populate the knowledge graph with real data. This meant diving deep into my academic records and transforming a raw list of courses into a meaningful visualization that accurately represents my Computer Engineering journey at Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile.

## Extracting Data from SIDING

The first challenge was gathering comprehensive course data from UC's academic platform, **SIDING** (Sistema de Información para la Docencia de Ingeniería). This platform serves as the central hub for all academic information, including the **Curricular Tracker** - a tool that maps every student's progress through their degree requirements.

### The SIDING Experience

SIDING's Curricular Tracker provided me with:
- **Complete course history**: Every course taken from 2019 to 2024
- **Course codes and official names**: Essential for accurate representation
- **Credit information**: Indicating the relative importance of each course
- **Prerequisite relationships**: Understanding the academic flow
- **Grade records**: Personal performance context

However, the raw data was just a long list of completed courses with codes like "IIC2133" and "MAT1610" - not immediately meaningful for visualization purposes.

## Academic Categorization Process

The next step involved organizing 80+ courses into logical macro-topics that would make sense both academically and professionally. This required understanding how different courses contribute to my overall engineering education.

### Defining Macro-Topics

I identified seven key areas that encompass the Computer Engineering curriculum:

#### 1. **Basic Engineering** (17 courses)
The foundational mathematics, physics, and general engineering courses that every engineer needs:
- Mathematics sequence: Calculus I-III, Linear Algebra, Differential Equations
- Physics fundamentals: Dynamics, Thermodynamics, Electricity & Magnetism
- General engineering: Chemistry, Biology, Economics, Ethics

#### 2. **Introductory Computer Engineering** (4 courses)
The gateway courses that introduce students to computational thinking:
- Introduction to Programming (IIC1103)
- Discrete Mathematics (IIC1253)
- Advanced Programming (IIC2233)
- Science and Technology in Digital Age (IIC1005)

#### 3. **Core Computer Engineering** (5 courses)
Essential computer science fundamentals that every software engineer must master:
- Data Structures and Algorithms (IIC2133)
- Computer Architecture (IIC2343)
- Operating Systems and Networks (IIC2333)
- Databases/SQL (IIC2413)
- Distributed Systems (IIC2523)

#### 4. **Theoretical Computer Science** (5 courses)
The mathematical and theoretical foundations of computing:
- Algorithm Analysis and Design (IIC2283)
- Theory of Automata and Formal Languages (IIC2223)
- Logics for Computer Science (IIC2213)
- Cryptography and Computer Security (IIC3243)
- High Performance Computing (IIC3533)

#### 5. **Data Science and AI** (8 courses)
My specialization area, focusing on machine learning and data analysis:
- Artificial Intelligence (IIC2613)
- Data Mining (IIC2433)
- Process Mining (IIC3757)
- Recommender Systems (IIC3633)
- Statistical Inference (EYP2114)
- Information Visualization (IIC2026)
- Data Science for Health (IIC3800)
- Advanced Topics in AI (IIC3692)

#### 6. **Software Engineering and Development** (5 courses)
Practical software development and engineering practices:
- Software Engineering (IIC2143)
- Web Applications (IIC2513)
- Software Architecture (IIC2173)
- Software Development (IIC3143)
- Specialty Project/Capstone (IIC2154)

#### 7. **Information Technology and Management** (2 courses)
Business and management aspects of technology:
- Information Systems (IIC2713)
- IT Project Management (IIC3113)

## Professional Relevance Weighting

The most critical step was assigning weights to each course based on their relevance to my career goals as a **Data Scientist** and **Full-Stack Developer**. This involved honest self-reflection about which courses truly impact my daily work and future aspirations.

### Weighting Criteria

I developed a relevance scale considering:
- **Direct applicability** to current projects and job requirements
- **Frequency of use** in real-world software development
- **Foundation strength** for advanced topics
- **Industry demand** and market relevance
- **Personal interest** and specialization goals

### Weight Categories

The courses were assigned relative sizes that translate to visual prominence in the graph:

**Extra Large (xl)**: Core competencies I use daily
- Data Structures and Algorithms
- Databases/SQL
- Web Applications
- Software Engineering

**Large (l)**: Essential skills for my career path
- Artificial Intelligence
- Data Mining
- Advanced Programming
- Software Architecture

**Medium-Large (ml)**: Important foundational knowledge
- Computer Architecture
- Operating Systems
- Distributed Systems

**Medium (m)**: Solid background knowledge
- Discrete Mathematics
- Process Mining
- Software Development

**Small (s-xs)**: Specialized or less directly applicable
- Basic engineering courses
- Theoretical computer science topics
- General education requirements

## Implementation Challenges

### Balancing Academic vs. Professional Perspective

One of the trickiest aspects was balancing academic importance with professional relevance. For example:
- **Calculus III** is academically fundamental but rarely used in web development
- **Process Mining** is highly specialized but directly relevant to my research interests
- **Ethics** is crucial for professional development but doesn't involve technical skills

### Avoiding Bias

I had to be careful not to undervalue courses simply because I found them challenging or less interesting at the time. Some courses that seemed theoretical during study (like **Cryptography**) proved valuable in understanding modern security practices.

### Maintaining Academic Integrity

The visualization needed to accurately represent the comprehensive nature of engineering education, not just highlight my preferred subjects. This meant ensuring adequate representation of all seven macro-topics.

## Technical Implementation

The weighted course data was structured as a hierarchical graph:

```typescript
interface Node {
  id: number;
  label: string;
  size?: "xl" | "l" | "ml" | "m" | "ms" | "s" | "xs";
}
```

This allows the D3.js visualization to render nodes with different sizes based on professional relevance:

```typescript
.attr("r", (d: any) => {
  if (d.size === "xl") return 35;
  else if (d.size === "l") return 25;
  else if (d.size === "ml") return 20;
  // ... and so on
})
```

## Results and Insights

The final knowledge graph now contains:
- **82 total courses** across 5 years of study
- **7 macro-topics** representing different engineering domains
- **Weighted visualization** highlighting career-relevant skills
- **Hierarchical structure** showing academic progression

### Unexpected Discoveries

The categorization process revealed interesting patterns:
- **Data Science courses** represent only 10% of total coursework but 40% of career relevance
- **Basic Engineering** courses, while foundational, have limited direct application
- **Software Engineering** practices bridge theoretical knowledge and practical skills
- **Interdisciplinary courses** often prove more valuable than initially expected

## Future Enhancements

This comprehensive course mapping enables several planned features:
- **Interactive course details** with descriptions and projects
- **Skill clustering** to show related competencies
- **Timeline visualization** showing academic progression
- **Career path mapping** connecting courses to job requirements

The transformation from raw SIDING data to weighted knowledge graph demonstrates how academic records can become powerful tools for professional self-reflection and career communication.
